# Sorts
### Collection of sorting functions.

Generic sorting algorithms. Overloading of < and = required.

### Notes:
* (1) Insertion, selection, comb, counting, myHeap, merge and quicksort adapted from the textbook "Data Structures and Algorithms in C++", 4th edition, by Drozdek.
* (2) Radix sort inspiration from studying the Electronic Arts Standard Template Library (EASTL) source code.
* (3) Some code retrieved from here https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Sorting_Algorithms
* (4) Uses C++17 parallel algorithm feature for sort(), otherwise substitutes a concurrent MSVC++ Parallel Patterns Library version.
* (5) Compiled/tested with MS Visual Studio 2017 Community (v141), and Windows SDK version 10.0.17134.0
* (6) Compiled/tested with Eclipse Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a), using CDT 9.4.3 and MinGw gcc-g++ (6.3.0-1).
